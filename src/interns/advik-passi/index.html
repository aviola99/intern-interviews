      <p> The image I included, is one that I took last year. It is a picture of one of the promotional posters we made to inform people that Resident Assistant(RA) Applications were open. I included it, one because my face is in it, and I think it's always helpful to put faces to names. Secondly, because I truly love being an RA and this poster gives more context (than what my resume says) into why I love it so much. 
        After being put in a circle with 45 random students, having to host our first community meeting where I had to get these nervous, shy, and awkward 18 year-olds to interact and become a community, I feel like I can handle any social situation.  </p>
      <p> In an internship, I am hoping to witness different leadership styles and build on my experience on working in software engineering teams. I definitely want to learn new programming techniques and frameworks, and I'm always open to the challenge of working
        in a language that I haven't worked in before. I'm also excited to meet more computer scientists and learn about their different journeys'.  
      </p>
      <p> I want to be a sofware engineer because I love solving puzzles. From a good riddle, to a round of sudoku, to a 1000 piece physical puzzle, I'm up for it all. To me, software engineering is like solving puzzles, some small and some big, so it fits right in to my passion.
        When I am programming, I sometime lose track of time because of how much software engineering fascinates me, which to me is a clear sign that this is the right career path for me. I was once told by a teacher that "You're good at what you love, and you love what you're good at" and software 
      engineering checks those boxes for me. I'm honestly still figuring out what specialization I want to go into in Computer Science so I want to try it all, to be able to make an informed decision when the time comes! </p>
